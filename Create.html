    Problem Statement
</p>

<p style="font-size:1rem; text-decoration:underline;color:white;"> Measurement cups,utensils,and scales are a hassle to clean, take up too much space, and aren’t always accurate</p>
<p style="font-size:1rem;color:white;"> Often times recipes will give you different measurements. For that reason, in our households we usually have measuring cups and scales, but the amount of cups we may have or the space a scale may take may be too much sometimes.Individuals also have to go through the hassle of washing the cups afterwards as well as having a cluttered workspace. A scale is the most accurate when it comes to measurements but some people prefer cups. This
 problem is most common amongst professional bakers and chefs as well as anyone who wants the accuracy, and to 
create more storage space.

"> Measurements may not be accurate, according to McCorkle from the washington post, “ I recently decided to compare the two sets of metal measuring cups we have in our Food Lab. Just looking at them, I could tell there was no way they hold the same amount. And I was right.
If you’re printing the numbers and lines on the cup, it’s a machine.” If that goes out of alignment, the lines end up in the wrong place and voilà, a cup is no longer a cup.
There have been two innovations in regards to this problem, one which has been a non electronic universal measuring cup, which risks inaccurate measurements. The other being electronic which does the functions of a scale as well as has labels on the side for anyone that wants to go old school. 
The idea of “ What are the best cup brands”

"> After figuring out our persona and what type of individuals could be using products. We interviewed several candidates to see if our idea of the user was accurate, which ended with positive results. We then began to construct initial designs
                    for the product we were looking at and analyzed it using a pugh chart to see if it met all the requirements that we needed in order to tackle the problem. Through this we landed on the idea of the cup with a built in scale. The only
                    thing left to figure out now was how to produce something that was self-cleaning as well. Researching into kitchen appliances that had self-cleaning features, we took notes and came upon our final solution. In addition to the product
                    itself we decided to go the extra mile to help the interviewed users that had weightloss goals.
